================================================================================
Unit Tests for Character SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Validates the `Character` ORM model in `src.models.character`, ensuring the
correct table structure, columns, constraints, foreign key relationships, and
many-to-many associations for the SWAPI Voting API.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Table naming ("characters")
- All expected columns with proper constraints:
  - Primary key on `id`
  - Unique, non-nullable `name`
  - Nullable `gender`, `birth_year`, `homeworld_id`
  - ForeignKey constraint on `homeworld_id` referencing `planets.id`
- Many-to-many relationships with:
  - Films
  - Vehicles
  - Starships
  - Species
- Many-to-one relationship with:
  - Homeworld (Planet)
- Verification of secondary join tables
- Lazy loading strategy using 'selectin'

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy `class_mapper` for ORM mapping introspection
- Asserts database integrity via pytest
- Suitable for CI/CD validation to catch schema regressions
