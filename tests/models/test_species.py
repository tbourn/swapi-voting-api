================================================================================
Unit Tests for Species SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Verifies the correctness of the `Species` ORM model defined in `src.models.species`.
These tests ensure the database schema, constraints, and many-to-many relationships
adhere to design expectations in the SWAPI Voting API.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Correct table name declaration ("species")
- Column definitions and constraints (primary key, unique, indexing, nullability)
- Validation of many-to-many relationships with Films and Characters
- Verification of association (join) tables used in relationships
- Enforcement of lazy loading strategies for efficient querying

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `class_mapper` to introspect ORM relationships
- Confirms name column is unique, indexed, and non-nullable
- Ensures all other fields are nullable as designed
- Fully automated with `pytest` for reliable, repeatable validation in CI/CD
