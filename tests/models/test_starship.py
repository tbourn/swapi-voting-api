================================================================================
Unit Tests for Starship SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Validates the `Starship` ORM model defined in `src.models.starship`.
These tests ensure the database schema, constraints, and many-to-many
relationships conform to design expectations in the SWAPI Voting API.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Correct tablename declaration for the Starship table
- Column definitions and constraints (primary key, unique, nullable)
- Verification of indexing on primary key
- Proper configuration of many-to-many relationships to Films and Characters
  via association tables
- Enforcement of lazy loading strategies for efficient query performance

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `class_mapper` to introspect ORM relationships
- Confirms that secondary join tables match expected association tables
- Ensures strict schema contract for name uniqueness and required fields
- Fully automated with `pytest` for reliable CI/CD integration
