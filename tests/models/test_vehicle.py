================================================================================
Unit Tests for Vehicle SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Verifies the correctness of the `Vehicle` SQLAlchemy ORM model defined in
`src.models.vehicle`. Ensures that the database schema matches design
expectations and that all relationships and constraints are properly configured.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Vehicle model importability and tablename declaration
- Column definitions, constraints, and nullability
- Primary key configuration and indexing
- Relationship definitions, including join tables and lazy loading

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy class_mapper to inspect ORM mappings
- Validates association tables for many-to-many relationships with Films and Characters
- Ensures naming, indexing, and uniqueness constraints on the `name` column
- Confirms that all other fields allow NULL values by design
- Fully automated with `pytest` for integration in CI/CD
