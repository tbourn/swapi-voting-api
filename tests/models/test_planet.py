================================================================================
Unit Tests for Planet SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Validates the `Planet` ORM model in `src.models.planet`, ensuring the database
schema and relationships align with the SWAPI Voting API design.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Verifies correct table name declaration ("planets")
- Checks for expected columns and their constraints (primary key, unique, indexed)
- Ensures non-nullability of the name column
- Confirms all other columns are nullable as expected
- Validates many-to-many relationship with Films, including correct join table
- Confirms use of 'selectin' lazy loading strategy for efficient queries

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy's `class_mapper` for introspection of ORM mappings
- Enforces design-time expectations programmatically for maintainability
- Fully integrated with `pytest` for reliable, automated testing in CI/CD
