================================================================================
Unit Tests for Film SQLAlchemy Model
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Validates the `Film` ORM model in `src.models.film`, ensuring its database
table structure and relationships match the SWAPI Voting API specification.

Tested Responsibilities
------------------------
- Correct table naming ("films")
- Presence of all expected columns with proper constraints
  - Primary key on `id`
  - Unique, indexed `title`
- Definition of many-to-many relationships with:
  - Characters
  - Planets
  - Starships
  - Vehicles
  - Species
- Verification of secondary join tables
- Confirmation of 'selectin' lazy loading strategy for all relationships

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Uses SQLAlchemy `class_mapper` for deep introspection of ORM mappings
- Enforces schema design integrity in automated tests
- Designed for maintainability and CI/CD integration with pytest
