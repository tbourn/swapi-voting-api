================================================================================
SQLAlchemy ORM Model for Star Wars Vehicles
================================================================================

Overview
--------
This module defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for representing vehicles
in the Star Wars universe for the SWAPI Voting API. It maps the
'vehicles' table and specifies fields such as name, model, manufacturer,
and class, while establishing many-to-many relationships with Films
and Characters through association tables.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Map the 'vehicles' table to the relational database
- Define schema columns for vehicle attributes and metadata
- Configure many-to-many relationships with Films and Characters

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative Base model
- Async-compatible for Alembic migrations
- Uses 'selectin' loading for relationship efficiency
