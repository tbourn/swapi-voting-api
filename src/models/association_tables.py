================================================================================
Association Tables for SQLAlchemy ORM Many-to-Many Relationships
================================================================================

Overview
--------
This module defines the SQLAlchemy `Table` objects used to represent many-to-many
associations between core Star Wars domain models in the application. These
association tables enable rich relational mapping between entities such as
characters, films, vehicles, starships, species, and planets.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Define intermediary SQL tables for many-to-many relationships.
- Support SQLAlchemy ORM relationships via `secondary` joins.
- Provide explicit foreign key constraints for referential integrity.
- Ensure consistent primary key pairings for efficient joins.

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Declarative `Table` definitions using `Base.metadata`.
- Enforced composite primary keys on join columns.
- Seamless integration with SQLAlchemy ORM `relationship()` mappings.
