================================================================================
SQLAlchemy ORM Model for Star Wars Starships
================================================================================

Overview
--------
This module defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model for representing starships
in the Star Wars universe within the SWAPI Voting API. It maps the
'starships' table, specifying fields such as name, model, manufacturer,
and classification, and defines many-to-many relationships with Films
and Characters through association tables.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Map the 'starships' table in the relational database
- Define metadata columns for starship attributes
- Configure many-to-many relationships with Films and Characters

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative Base model
- Supports eager loading with 'selectin' strategy for relationships
- Async-compatible for Alembic migrations and modern SQLAlchemy usage
