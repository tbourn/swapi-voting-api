SQLAlchemy ORM Model Package for SWAPI Voting API
================================================================================

Overview
--------
This package defines the core SQLAlchemy ORM models used to represent
Star Wars entities in the SWAPI Voting API database schema. Each model
corresponds to a table with well-defined columns, constraints, and
relationships designed for normalized relational storage and efficient querying.

Exported Models
---------------
- Film: Represents Star Wars film records with metadata and many-to-many relationships.
- Character: Represents individual characters with attributes and join tables for relationships.
- Planet: Represents planetary data with many-to-many relationships to films.
- Starship: Represents starships, with relationships to films and characters.
- Vehicle: Represents vehicles, with relationships to films and characters.
- Species: Represents biological species, with join tables linking to films and characters.

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Declarative SQLAlchemy model definitions.
- Explicit many-to-many join relationships via association tables.
- Designed for FastAPI integration with Pydantic serialization.
- Supports maintainable, testable, and evolvable database schema.
