================================================================================
SQLAlchemy ORM Model for Star Wars Characters
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM model representing the 'characters' table
in the application's relational database schema. The Character entity
captures key properties such as name, gender, and birth year, and
establishes many-to-many and many-to-one relationships with other
domain models, including films, vehicles, starships, species, and planets.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Store canonical data about individual Star Wars characters.
- Support relational queries linking characters to their appearances
  in films, the vehicles and starships they use, their species classification,
  and their homeworld planet.

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Declarative SQLAlchemy ORM mapping using Base.
- Comprehensive many-to-many associations via association tables.
- Foreign key and relationship mapping to Planets for homeworld linkage.
- Optimized with selectin-loading for performance.
