================================================================================
Pydantic Schemas for Star Wars Films
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Defines the Pydantic models used to validate, parse, and serialize film-related
data for the SWAPI Voting API. Supports both request and response payloads,
including nested relationships with characters, planets, starships, vehicles,
and species.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Provide base schema for shared film fields
- Define creation schema for film input
- Define response schema with database ID and nested related entities

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Designed for FastAPI with OpenAPI documentation support
- orm_mode enabled for SQLAlchemy integration
- Supports nested serialization of related resources
