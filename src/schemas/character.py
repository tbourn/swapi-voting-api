================================================================================
Pydantic Schemas for Star Wars Characters
================================================================================

Overview
--------
Defines the Pydantic models for validating, parsing, and serializing
character-related data in the SWAPI Voting API. These schemas ensure
type safety and clarity for both incoming requests and outgoing responses,
including nested Film relationships for richer API output.

Responsibilities
----------------
- Provide a base schema with shared character fields
- Define a creation schema for character input
- Define a response schema with database ID and related films

Key Characteristics
--------------------
- Fully compatible with FastAPI for OpenAPI docs generation
- Enables orm_mode for seamless SQLAlchemy integration
- Supports nested FilmBase serialization for related resources
